## üéÆ Interests & Hobbies
- **Video Games**: The fundamental origin of all nerds, video games have been a hobby of mine for as long as I can remember. Be it Zelda or COD, Mario or Skyrim, I love all sorts of games, and actively look forward to the latest releases, while still enjoying timeless classics.
- **Anime**: Another staple of nerd culture, I find myself enjoying all sorts of anime, though I must admit that I have a bit of a bias towards shonen.
- **Photography**: A more recent hobby of mine, I have found that I love photography, especially aerial photography. My favorite things to photograph are dilapitad structures and mountainous views.
- **Mythology**: I mostly attribute my deep-rooted love of cultures and languages to my fascination with mythologies. Delving into the foundational understanding and cultural significances of mythology led to a greater appreciation for all things cultural and foreign.
- **Building PC's**: Although an unexpected interet, I feel that building PC's has helped me significantly in computer science, as it gives me a greater understanding and appreciation for the technology that I use to pursue my hobbies and to further my career everyday.
